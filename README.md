# Enhancing Lossy Images with GANs

## Overview

### Implemntation

Our implemntation was using the exising [ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN) implentation to train 
different dataets modiefy w/ mthod of lossy data. The project had difficult implementing to our liking; however, below will show 
the process we tried to run. Another method was to try to implement our ambientgan, but that proved to diffucult as well.
