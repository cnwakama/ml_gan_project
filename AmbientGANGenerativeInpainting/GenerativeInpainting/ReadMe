To train this model, please make sure your training and validation data is saved into the folder structure needed for running flistCreator.py. The data we used
came from the Places2 dataset.

This model uses Tensorflow 1.X, and as such you will need to be running a Python version that supports this, so Python 3.7 or lower.

Once you have successfully generated the flist files, refer to the READ ME of the Generative Inpainting model created by Jiahui Yu to train the model.
